1.Write an essay covering the history and evolution of C programming. Explain

its importance and why it is still used today.
C, developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs, became foundational for systems programming and enabled the portability of Unix. Its efficiency, low-level control, and portability keep it vital today, especially in operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical software. Many modern languages and technologies are built on concepts introduced by C, ensuring its continued relevance.

2.Install a C compiler on your system and configure the IDE. Write your first
program to print "Hello, World!" and run it.
installing GCC Compiler

1.Windows: Install MinGW or TDM-GCC, then add the bin folder to the system PATH so gcc can run from the command line.

2.Linux: Use the terminal and run: sudo apt install build-essential (Ubuntu) or the equivalent package for your distro.

3.Mac: Install Xcode Command Line Tools using xcode-select --install to get gcc/clang.

Setting Up an IDE

Dev-C++: Download and install; it usually comes bundled with a GCC compiler—no extra setup needed.

CodeBlocks: Choose the version with MinGW included, install, and the IDE auto-detects GCC.

VS Code: Install the C/C++ extension, set up GCC or Clang separately, and configure a simple build task for compiling and running C programs.

3.Write a C program that includes variables, constants, and comments. Declare
and use different data types (int, char, float) and display their values.

Basic Structure of a C Program

1.Headers: Include libraries needed for functions.
#include <stdio.h>   // for printf, scanf

2.Main Function: Entry point of every C program.
int main() {
    // code
    return 0;
}

3.Comments: Notes for the programmer; ignored by the compiler.
// This is a single-line comment
/* This is a multi-line comment */

4.Data Types: Define the type of data used.
Common types: int, float, char, double.

5.Variables: Named storage locations with a data type.
int age = 21;
float price = 81.5;
char grade = 'A';

Example Program

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {                 // main function
    int age = 21;            // variable (int type)
    printf("Age = %d", age); // print output
    return 0;
}

4.Write notes explaining each type of operator in C: arithmetic, relational,
logical, assignment, increment/decrement, bitwise, and conditional operators.


1. Arithmetic Operators :

Used for mathematical operations.
Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
Example: `a + b`, `x % y`

2. Relational Operators:

Used to compare two values; result is true (1) or false (0).
Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
Example: `a > b`

3. Logical Operators:

Used to combine conditions; return true or false.
Operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT)
Example: `a > 0 && b > 0`

4. Assignment Operators:

Used to assign values to variables.
Operators: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
Example: `x += 5` (x = x + 5)

5. Increment/Decrement Operators:

Increase or decrease value by 1.
Operators: `++`, `--`
Example:`i++`, `--j`

6. Bitwise Operators:

Perform operations on binary bits.
Operators: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`
Example: `a & b`, `a << 1`

5.Explain decision-making statements in C (if, else, nested if-else, switch).
Provide examples of each.


1. if Statement:

Executes a block when a condition is true.


if (a > 0) {
    printf("Positive");
}


2. if-else Statement:

Executes one block if true, another if false.


if (age >= 18)
    printf("Adult");
else
    printf("Minor");


3. Nested if-else:

An if-else inside another if-else.


if (marks >= 90)
    printf("Grade A");
else if (marks >= 75)
    printf("Grade B");
else
    printf("Grade C");


4. switch Statement:

Used when choosing from multiple fixed options.

switch (day) {
    case 1: printf("Monday"); break;
    case 2: printf("Tuesday"); break;
    default: printf("Invalid");
}

6.Compare and contrast while loops, for loops, and do-while loops. Explain the
scenarios in which each loop is most appropriate.


while Loop

Checks condition first runs only if condition is true.
Best when the number of iterations is unknown.


while (i < 5) { ... }

for Loop

Combines initialization, condition, and update in one line.
Best when the number of iterations is known or counted.

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }


do-while Loop

Runs at least once because condition is checked after the loop body.
Best when you need the loop to run at least one time, such as menu-driven programs.


do { ... } while (i < 5);

7.Explain the use of break, continue, and goto statements in C. Provide
examples of each.


1. break

Exits the nearest loop or `switch` immediately.

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) break; // loop stops when i = 3
    printf("%d ", i);
}


 2. continue

Skips the current iteration and moves to the next loop cycle.


for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) continue; // skips printing 3
    printf("%d ", i);
}


3. goto

Jumps to a labeled statement in the program.


int i = 1;
loop:
printf("%d ", i);
i++;
if (i <= 5) goto loop;


>> `goto` is generally discouraged because it can make code hard to read.

8.What are functions in C? Explain function declaration, definition, and how to
call a function. Provide examples.

Functions in C

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused.

1. Function Declaration (Prototype)

Tells the compiler about the function’s name, return type, and parameters.

int add(int, int);  // declaration


2. Function Definition

Contains the actual code of the function.


int add(int a, int b) {  // definition
    return a + b;
}


3. Function Call

Invokes the function to perform its task.


int result = add(5, 3);  // call
printf("%d", result);    // output: 8


>> Functions help in modular programming, code reusability, and easier debugging.

9.Explain the concept of arrays in C. Differentiate between one-dimensional and
multi-dimensional arrays with examples.

Arrays in C

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
Syntax: `data_type array_name[size];`


1. One-Dimensional Array:

Stores elements in a single row.
Example:
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

2. Multi-Dimensional Array:

Stores data in multiple rows and columns (like a matrix).
Example (2D array):
int matrix[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};

10.Explain what pointers are in C and how they are declared and initialized. Why
are pointers important in C?

Pointers in C

A pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable.

Declaration and Initialization

int a = 10;      // normal variable
int *ptr = &a;   // pointer storing address of a

`*ptr` → value at the address
`&a` → address of variable a

----Importance of Pointers----

1.Enable direct memory access
2. Allow dynamic memory allocation
3. Useful for arrays, strings, and functions (passing by reference)
4. Essential in data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.

11.Explain string handling functions like strlen(), strcpy(), strcat(),
strcmp(), and strchr(). Provide examples of when these functions are
useful.

1. `strlen()`

Returns the length of a string (excluding `\0`).


char str[] = "Hello";
int len = strlen(str); // len = 5

Use: To find string size.

2. `strcpy()`

Copies one string to another.

char src[] = "Hello";
char dest[10];
strcpy(dest, src); // dest = "Hello"

Use: To duplicate strings.

3. `strcat()`

Concatenates (joins) two strings.

char str1[20] = "Hello ";
char str2[] = "World";
strcat(str1, str2); // str1 = "Hello World"

Use: To combine strings.

4. `strcmp()`

Compares two strings; returns 0 if equal.

strcmp("abc", "abc"); // returns 0
strcmp("abc", "xyz"); // returns <0
```

Use: To check string equality or order.

5. `strchr()`

Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.

char str[] = "Hello";
char *ptr = strchr(str, 'l'); // points to first 'l'
```

Use: To locate a character in a string.

12.Explain the concept of structures in C. Describe how to declare, initialize, and
access structure members.

Structures in C

A structure is a user-defined data type that groups different types of variables under a single name.

Declaration

struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float marks;
};


Initialization

struct Student s1 = {"Your name", 20, 85.5};


Accessing Members

printf("%s", s1.name);  // Access name
s1.age = 21;            // Modify age
```

Use: Structures are useful for representing complex data like records, objects, or entities in a program.

13.Explain the importance of file handling in C. Discuss how to perform file
operations like opening, closing, reading, and writing files.


Importance of File Handling

File handling allows a program to store data permanently on disk, read/write data, and manage large amounts of information beyond program memory.


File Operations in C

1. Opening a File

FILE *fp;
fp = fopen("data.txt", "r"); // r=read, w=write, a=append

2. Closing a File

fclose(fp);


3. Reading from a File

char str[100];
fgets(str, 100, fp);  // reads a line


4. Writing to a File


fprintf(fp, "Hello World\n"); // writes text to file


Use: File handling is essential for data storage, logging, and persistent programs.
