Types of Internet Connections :

LAB EXERCISE : 

1). Research different types of internet connections (e.g., broadband, fiber, satellite) 
and list their pros and cons. 

1).Broadband (DSL / Cable)

- Pros
Widely available
Affordable
Easy installation
Suitable for home and small offices

- Cons
Speed decreases with distance (DSL)
Shared bandwidth (Cable)
Slower than fiber
Network congestion during peak hours

2️).Fiber Optic Internet

-Pros
Extremely high speed (up to Gbps)
Very low latency
Reliable and stable
Ideal for streaming, gaming, cloud apps

- Cons
Limited availability (mostly urban areas)
Expensive installation
Higher monthly cost

3️).Satellite Internet

- Pros
Available in rural and remote locations
No physical cable required
Wide coverage

- Cons
High latency (delay)
Affected by weather
Expensive equipment
Slower than fiber and broadband

4️). Mobile Data (4G / 5G)

- Pros
Portable and flexible
Easy setup
Good speed (especially 5G)
Ideal for smartphones and hotspots

- Cons
Data limits
Network congestion
Speed depends on signal strength
Can be costly for heavy usage

5️).Dial-Up Internet

- Pros
Low cost
Available in remote areas
Simple technology

- Cons
Extremely slow
Blocks phone line during use
Not suitable for modern applications

Protocols : 

LAB EXERCISE: 

1). Simulate HTTP and FTP requests using command line tools (e.g., curl).

- HTTP Request Simulation
  1) HTTP GET Request
  2) View HTTP Request & Response Headers
  3) HTTP POST Request (Send Data)
  4) Save HTTP Response to a File
  5) Simulate Authentication (Basic Auth)

- FTP Request Simulation
  1) FTP Server Connection (Anonymous Login)
  2) Download File via FTP
  3) Upload File to FTP Server
  4) Download Using FTP Authentication

=========================================================

Application Security 

LAB EXERCISE: 

1). Identify and explain three common application security vulnerabilities. Suggest 
possible solutions. 

- SQL Injection
Occurs when attackers insert malicious SQL queries through input fields to access or modify the database.
Solution: Use prepared statements, input validation, and parameterized queries.

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Happens when malicious scripts are injected into web pages and executed in users’ browsers.
Solution: Validate inputs, encode outputs, and use Content Security Policy (CSP).

- Broken Authentication
Weak authentication allows attackers to hijack user accounts or sessions.
Solution: Use strong passwords, secure session handling, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Software Applications and Its Types 

LAB EXERCISE:

1).  Identify and classify 5 applications you use daily as either system software or 
application software.

Windows OS – System Software
Manages hardware, memory, files, and runs applications.

Android OS – System Software
Controls mobile hardware and provides a platform for apps.

Google Chrome – Application Software
Used for browsing the internet and accessing websites.

WhatsApp – Application Software
Used for messaging, voice, and video calls.

Microsoft Word – Application Software
Used for creating and editing documents.

=========================================================

Software Environments 

LAB EXERCISE:

1). Explore different types of software environments (development, testing, production). 
Set up a basic environment in a virtual machine.

1. Software Environments
a) Development Environment

Purpose: Used by developers to write and modify code.
Features:

Debugging tools enabled

Frequent code changes

Local databases or mock services

Example:
Developer’s laptop with VS Code, Java/Python, local MySQL.

b) Testing Environment

Purpose: Used by testers to verify functionality and find bugs.
Features:

Stable build from development

Test data

Used for manual and automation testing

Example:
QA server running the application with Selenium tests.

c) Production Environment

Purpose: Live environment used by real users.
Features:

High security

Optimized performance

Real data

Example:
Live e-commerce website used by customers.

2. Setting Up a Basic Environment in a Virtual Machine (VM)
Step 1: Install Virtualization Software

Install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation

Step 2: Download OS ISO

Download Ubuntu Linux or Windows ISO

Step 3: Create a Virtual Machine

Open VirtualBox

Click New

Select OS type and version

Allocate RAM (e.g., 4 GB)

Create virtual hard disk (e.g., 20 GB)

Step 4: Install Operating System

Attach the ISO file

Start the VM

Follow OS installation steps

Step 5: Set Up Basic Tools

Install required software:

Code editor (VS Code)

Programming language (Java / Python)

Database (MySQL)

Browser (Chrome)

=========================================================

Types of Software 

LAB EXERCISE: 

1). Create a list of software you use regularly and classify them into the following 
categories: system, application, and utility software.

1. System Software

Windows OS – Manages computer hardware and resources
Android OS – Manages mobile device operations
Linux (Ubuntu) – Provides an operating system environment

2. Application Software

Google Chrome – Web browsing
Microsoft Word – Document creation
WhatsApp – Messaging and calling
Zoom – Video conferencing
Spotify – Music streaming

3. Utility Software

Windows Defender – Antivirus protection
Disk Cleanup – Removes unnecessary files
WinRAR – File compression
CCleaner – System cleanup
Backup & Restore – Data backup
Limited access

=========================================================

Software Testing 

LAB EXERCISE: 

1). Develop test cases for a simple calculator program. 

- Open the calculator application
- Enter the first number
- Select the required operation (Add / Subtract / Multiply / Divide)
- Enter the second number
- Click the Calculate / = button
- Verify the displayed result with the expected output
- Repeat the steps for different operations and inputs
- Check error handling (e.g., division by zero, invalid input)
