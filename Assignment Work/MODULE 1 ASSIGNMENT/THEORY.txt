Module 1 – Overview of IT Industry :

THEORY EXERCISE :

1). What is a Program?

1.1) Explain in your own words what a program is and how it functions. 
- A program is a set of instructions written to tell a computer what tasks to perform.

2). What is Programming?

2.1) What are the key steps involved in the programming process? 
- The key steps in the programming process are understanding the problem, designing a solution (algorithm), writing the code, testing and debugging it, and finally maintaining or improving the program.

3). Types of Programming Languages

3.1) What are the main differences between high-level and low-level programming languages?
- High-level languages are easy for humans to read and write, while low-level languages are closer to machine code and harder to understand.

4). World Wide Web & How Internet Works

4.1) Describe the roles of the client and server in web communication. 
- The client requests information or services, usually through a web browser.
  The server processes the request and sends the required data or response back to the client.

5). Network Layers on Client and Server

5.1) Explain the function of the TCP/IP model and its layers. 
- The TCP/IP model is used to enable communication over the internet by dividing data transmission into layers.
   Its layers are Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Access, each handling a specific task like data delivery and routing.

6). Client and Servers

6.1) Explain Client Server Communication 
- Client-server communication is a process where the client sends a request to the server, and the server processes that request and sends back a response.

7). Types of Internet Connections

7.1) How does broadband differ from fiber-optic internet?
- Broadband uses copper cables or wireless signals and usually offers lower speeds.
  Fiber-optic internet uses light through fiber cables, providing much faster speeds and more reliable connections.

8). Protocols

8.1) What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS protocols? 
- HTTP transfers data in plain text and is not secure.
  HTTPS encrypts the data using SSL/TLS, making communication secure and protecting user information.

9). Application Security 

9.1) What is the role of encryption in securing applications? 
- Encryption protects data by converting it into a secure coded form that unauthorized users cannot read.
  It ensures data privacy and security during storage and transmission.

10). Software Applications and Its Types

10.1) What is the difference between system software and application software?
- System software manages and controls computer hardware and provides a platform for other software to run.
  Application software is designed to help users perform specific tasks like writing documents or browsing the internet.

11). Software Architecture

11.1)  What is the significance of modularity in software architecture? 
- Modularity divides software into independent, reusable components.
  It makes programs easier to develop, test, maintain, and scale.

12). Layers in Software Architecture

12.1) Why are layers important in software architecture? 
- Layers organize software into structured levels with specific responsibilities.
  They improve maintainability, scalability, and make the system easier to understand and modify.

13). Software Environments

13.1) Explain the importance of a development environment in software production.
- A development environment provides tools to write, test, and debug code efficiently.
  It helps developers build reliable software faster and with fewer errors.

14). Source Code

14.1) What is the difference between source code and machine code?
- Source code is human-readable code written by programmers.
  Machine code is binary code that the computer can directly understand and execute.

15). Github and Introductions

15.1) Why is version control important in software development? 
- Version control tracks changes in code and allows multiple developers to work together safely.
  It helps prevent data loss, manage updates, and restore previous versions when needed.

16). Student Account in Github

16.1) What are the benefits of using Github for students? 
- GitHub helps students store and manage their code online and track changes easily.

17). Types of Software

17.1) What are the differences between open-source and proprietary software?
- Open-source software is freely available, and its code can be modified and shared by anyone.
  Proprietary software is owned by a company, and users cannot see, modify, or freely distribute its code.

18). GIT and GITHUB Training 

18.1) How does GIT improve collaboration in a software development team?
- GIT allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
  It tracks all modifications, manages versions, and makes merging updates and resolving conflicts easier.

19). Application Software 

19.1) What is the role of application software in businesses?
- Application software helps businesses perform specific tasks like accounting, communication, data analysis, and customer management.

20). Software Development Process

20.1) What are the main stages of the software development process? 
- Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance

21). Software Requirement 

21.1) Why is the requirement analysis phase critical in software development?
- Requirement analysis is critical because it defines what the software must do.
  Accurate requirements prevent misunderstandings, reduce errors, and ensure the final product meets user needs.

22). Software Analysis 

22.1) What is the role of software analysis in the development process?
- Software analysis examines user needs and system requirements to plan an effective solution.

23). System Design 

23.1) What are the key elements of system design?
- Architecture Design, Interface Design, Data Design, Component Design

24). Software Testing 

24.1) Why is software testing important?
- Software testing is important to identify and fix errors before release.

25). Maintenance

25.1) What types of software maintenance are there?
- Corrective Maintenance, Adaptive Maintenance, Perfective Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance

26). Development

26.1) What are the key differences between web and desktop applications? 
- Web applications run in a browser and are accessible from any device with internet, while desktop applications are installed on a specific computer.
  Web apps are easier to update and maintain, whereas desktop apps can work offline and often have faster performance.

27). Web Application

27.1) What are the advantages of using web applications over desktop applications?
- Web applications are accessible from anywhere with internet, require no installation, and are easier to update and maintain.

28). Designing 

28.1) What role does UI/UX design play in application development? 
- UI/UX design ensures applications are user-friendly, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.

29). Mobile Application

29.1) What are the differences between native and hybrid mobile apps? 
- Native apps are built for a specific platform (iOS or Android) and offer better performance and access to device features.
  Hybrid apps work across multiple platforms using a single codebase but may have lower performance and limited device access.

30). DFD (Data Flow Diagram) 

30.1) What is the significance of DFDs in system analysis? 
- DFDs (Data Flow Diagrams) visually represent how data moves through a system.

31). Desktop Application 

31.1)  What are the pros and cons of desktop applications compared to web applications?
- Pros of Desktop Applications:
  Can work offline.
  Usually faster and more responsive.
  Full access to system resources.

- Cons of Desktop Applications:
  Must be installed on each device.
  Updates are harder to deploy.
  Limited accessibility from other devices.

- Pros of Web Applications:
  Accessible from anywhere with internet.
  Easy to update and maintain.
  Cross-platform compatibility.

- Cons of Web Applications:
  Dependent on internet connection.
  Often slower than desktop apps.
  Limited access to device hardware.

32). Flow Chart 

32.1) How do flowcharts help in programming and system design? 
- Flowcharts visually represent the steps and decisions in a process or program.
