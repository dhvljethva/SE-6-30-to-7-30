1.1 What are the key differences between Procedural Programming and Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP)?
Procedural Programming (POP) FUNCTION BASED

1.Focuses on functions and procedures

2.Data and functions are separate

3.Follows a step-by-step approach

4.Good for small programs

Example: C, simple C++ programs without classes

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) OBJECT BASED

1.Focuses on objects and classes

2.Data and functions are together inside classes

3.Supports concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

4.Good for large and complex programs

Example: C++, Java, Python (OOP features)

1.2 List and explain the main advantages of OOP over POP.

Advantages of OOP over POP:

1. Reusability
2. Encapsulation
3. Easy to Maintain
4. Inheritance
5. Better Organization
6. Flexibility (Polymorphism)

1.3 Explain the steps involved in setting up a C++ development environment.

Steps to set up a C++ development environment :

1.Install a C++ compiler – e.g., GCC (Linux), Clang (macOS), or MSVC via Visual Studio (Windows).
2.Install an IDE or code editor – e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion.
3.Configure the compiler – ensure the compiler path is set in system environment variables (if needed).
4.Set up build tools – optionally install CMake or Make for managing projects.
5.Write and compile a test program – create a simple “Hello, World” program to verify everything works.

1.4 What are the main input/output operations in C++? Provide examples.


Main Input/Output operations in C++:

1.Input: `cin` – used to take input from the user
  int x;
  cin >> x;
  
2.Output:`cout` – used to display output on the screen
  cout << "Value of x is " << x;

3.New line: `endl` or `\n` – used to move to a new line

4.cout << "Hello" << endl;

5.Header file: `<iostream>` – required for input/output operations
  #include <iostream>
 
2.1 What are the different data types available in C++? Explain with examples.

Data Types in C++:

1.Basic (Primitive) Data Types

   `int` – stores integers
     int a = 10;
    
   `float` – stores decimal numbers
     float b = 5.5;
     
   `double` – stores large decimal numbers
     double c = 12.345;
    
   `char` – stores a single character
     char ch = 'A';

2.Derived Data Types

   `array`
     int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
     
   `pointer`
     int *p = &a;
     

3.User-Defined Data Types

   `struct`
    struct Student { int id; };
     
   `enum`
     enum Day {Mon, Tue};
     

4.Void
  
  `void` – represents no value
    void display();
     
2.2 Explain the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion in C++.

Type Conversion in C++ :
1.Implicit: Automatic by compiler.
2.Explicit: Manual by programmer.


1.Implicit Conversion (Type Casting):
  
   Automatically done by the compiler.
   Example:
   int a = 10;
   float b = a;  // int automatically converted to float
     

2.Explicit Conversion (Type Casting):

   Manually done by the programmer.
   Uses cast operators like `(type)` or `static_cast<type>()`.
   Example:
   float x = 5.7;
   int y = (int)x;  // float explicitly converted to int

2.3 What are the different types of operators in C++? Provide examples of each.

--> C++ operators are categorized into arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, increment/decrement, conditional, and others, each performing specific operations on data.


Types of Operators in C++ (Short):

1.Arithmetic Operators – Perform mathematical operations.

   int a = 10, b = 5;
   cout << a + b; // Addition
   cout << a - b; // Subtraction
   cout << a * b; // Multiplication
   cout << a / b; // Division
   cout << a % b; // Modulus
   ```

2.Relational Operators – Compare values and return `true` or `false`.

   cout << (a > b);  // Greater than
   cout << (a == b); // Equal to
   cout << (a != b); // Not equal to
   

3.Logical Operators – Perform logical operations.

   bool x = true, y = false;
   cout << (x && y); // AND
   cout << (x || y); // OR
   cout << (!x);     // NOT
   ```

4.Bitwise Operators – Operate on bits of integers.

   cout << (a & b); // AND
   cout << (a | b); // OR
   cout << (a ^ b); // XOR
   cout << (~a);    // NOT
   cout << (a << 1); // Left shift
   cout << (a >> 1); // Right shift
   

5.Assignment Operators – Assign values to variables.

   int c;
   c = a;   // =
   c += a;  // +=
   c -= b;  // -=
   

6.Increment/Decrement Operators – Increase or decrease value by 1.

   a++; // Post-increment
   ++b; // Pre-increment
   a--; // Post-decrement
   --b; // Pre-decrement
   

7.Conditional (Ternary) Operator – Short form of `if-else`.

   int max = (a > b) ? a : b;


2.4 Explain the purpose and use of constants and literals in C++.

--> Constants ensure important values remain unchanged.
--> Literals  represent fixed values directly in the program for clarity and simplicity.


Constants and Literals in C++:

1.Constants:

   Fixed values that cannot be changed  during program execution.
   Declared using `const` keyword.
   Example:
   const int MAX = 100;
     

2. Literals:

   Direct fixed values written in the code.
   Can be of different types: integer, floating-point, character, string, boolean.
   Examples:
   10        // integer literal
    3.14      // float literal
    'A'       // character literal
    "Hello"   // string literal


3.1 What are conditional statements in C++? Explain the if-else and switch statements.

if–else Statement

The if–else statement checks a condition:

If the condition is true, the if block runs

Otherwise, the else block runs

switch Statement

The switch statement is used when there are multiple fixed choices.
It checks a variable and executes the matching case.


3.2 What is the difference between for, while, and do-while loops in C++?
                                                                                    
1.for loop:          Used when the number of iterations is known in advance.                     
2.while loop:       Used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition. 
3.do–while loop:  Similar to `while`, but the loop **executes at least once.
                    

3.3 How are break and continue statements used in loops? Provide examples.
--> break and continue are loop control statements used to change the normal flow of loops.

break → exits the loop

continue → skips current loop iteration

1.break Statement:
>Terminates the loop completely
>Control moves outside the loop

example:
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3)
        break;
    cout << i << " ";
}
 
output : 1 2 

2.continue Statement
>Skips the current iteration
>Moves to the next iteration of the loop


for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3)
        continue;
    cout << i << " ";
}
output: 1 2 4 5 


3.4 Explain nested control structures with an example.

Any control structure (loop or if-else) can be nested inside another.
Nested control structures mean placing one control structure inside another, such as a loop inside a loop or an if inside a loop.
They are used to handle more complex conditions or repeated patterns.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int rows = 4;

    for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {        // Outer loop → rows
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {       // Inner loop → stars in a row
            cout << "* ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}


4.1 What is a function in C++? Explain the concept of function declaration, definition, and calling.

A function in C++ is a block of code that performs a specific task. It helps make programs simple, reusable, and organized.

1. Function Declaration

Tells the compiler about the function name, return type, and parameters.

int add(int, int);

2. Function Definition

Contains the actual code of the function.

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

 3. Function Calling

Uses the function in the program.

int result = add(5, 3);


Declaration --->Function info
Definition ---> Function work
Calling --->Using the function


4.2 What is the scope of variables in C++? Differentiate between local and global scope.

1.Local Scope:
Variable declared inside a function or block
Can be used only within that function or block

2.Global Scope:
Variable declared outside all functions
Can be used anywhere in the program

-->Scope helps control variable usage and avoid errors.

4.3 Explain recursion in C++ with an example.

Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem.

1.Base case – stops the recursion.
2.Recursive call – function calls itself.

EXAMPLE:
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0)
        return 1;          // Base case
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive call
}

4.4 What are function prototypes in C++? Why are they used?
A function prototype tells the compiler about a function before it is used.

Why Are They Used?

1.Let the compiler know function name, return type, and parameters
2.Allow functions to be defined after main()
3.Help avoid errors in function c


5.1 What are arrays in C++? Explain the difference between single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

Array: An array in C++ is a collection of multiple values of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations and accessed using an index.

Example: int marks[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

1.Single-Dimensional Array:

1.Stores data in one row (list form)
2.Uses one index
3.Used to store simple lists (marks, numbers)

Example: int a[3] = {1, 2, 3};

2.Multi-Dimensional Array[2D array]:

 Stores data in rows and columns (table form)
Uses two or more indices
Used for matrices or tables.

Example: int b[2][2] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};


5.2 Explain string handling in C++ with examples.

>>String handling in C++ means working with text (characters).
>>C++ mainly uses the string class.

Example:
string s = "Hello";
cout << s.length();   // Length
cout << s + " World"; // Join strings


Common operations:

Find length → `s.length()`
Join strings → `+`
Compare strings → `==`
Access characters → `s[i]`

In simple words: Strings are used to store and manipulate text in C++.


5.3 How are arrays initialized in C++? Provide examples of both 1D and 2D arrays.

Array initialization in C++ means assigning values to an array at the time of declaration.

1D Array (Single-Dimensional): A 1D array stores values in a list.
Example: int numbers[4] = {10, 20, 30, 40};

 2D Array (Two-Dimensional): A 2D array stores values in rows and columns (table form).
Example:

int matrix[2][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6}
};

1D array → list of values
2D array → table of values

5.4 Explain string operations and functions in C++.

String Operations and Functions in C++ : In C++, strings are used to store and work with text. The `string` class makes string operations easy.

Common String Operations & Functions:

1. Declaring a String: string s = "Hello";
2. Length of String: s.length();    //Returns number of characters
3.Concatenation (Join Strings):
string a = "Hi";
string b = "There";
cout << a + " " + b;   // Hi There

4.Compare Strings:
if (a == b)
    cout << "Equal";

5. Access Characters:
cout << s[0];   // First character

6.Input String:
string name;
cin >> name;        // Single word
getline(cin, name); // Full line


In Simple Words:

1.Strings store text
2.`length()` finds size
3.`+` joins strings
4.`==` compares strings
5.`[]` accesses characters


6.1 Explain the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is based on a few core concepts:

Class: A plan or template (like a blueprint of a house).
Object: A real thing made from the class (the actual house).
Encapsulation: Keeping data safe inside the object.
Abstraction: Showing only what is needed, hiding the rest.
Inheritance: One class using features of another class.
Polymorphism: Same action, different behavior.

-->OOP helps us organize code in an easy and clean way.

6.2 What are classes and objects in C++? Provide an example.

Classes and Objects in C++:
Class: A class is a blueprint or template. It defines what data (variables) and   actions (functions) an object will have.

Object: An object is a real instance of a class. It uses the class to create something that works.

Example:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Class definition
class Car 
{
public:
    string brand;
    int speed;

    void showInfo() 
{
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << endl;
        cout << "Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

int main()
 {
    // Object creation
    Car myCar;

    // Assign values
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.speed = 120;

    // Call function
    myCar.showInfo();

    return 0;
}

6.3 What is inheritance in C++? Explain with an example.

Inheritance means one class can use the properties and functions of another class.
It helps reuse code and makes programs easier to manage.

-->Parent (Base) class: The class being inherited from
-->Child (Derived) class: The class that inherits



 Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class
class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Animal is eating" << endl;
    }
};

6.4 What is encapsulation in C++? How is it achieved in classes? 

Encapsulation means wrapping data and the functions that use it into one unit (class) and protecting the data from direct access.

 It helps keep data safe and code well-organized.


How Encapsulation is Achieved :

Encapsulation is done by:

1. Using a class
2. Using access specifiers:

      private → data hidden (default).
      public → accessible from outside.
      protected → accessible in derived classes.


// Derived class
class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog is barking" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog d;

    d.eat();   // From Animal class
    d.bark();  // From Dog class

    return 0;
}

*inheritance allows one class to use and extend another class’s features.*
